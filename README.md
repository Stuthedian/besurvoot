## Navigation
### Basic
Standard vi-like navigation: '*jk*'. Arrow keys also supported.

To quickly access particular item type its number followed by '*gg*' or '*G*'.
Up to 3 digits in number supported.


## Managing items
To add an item press '*O*'. There is no feature to somehow "cancel" an input: pressing escape key will insert escape character
